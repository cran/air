Description: An R console utility that lets you ask R related questions to the
    'OpenAI' large language model. It can answer 'how-to()' questions by  
    providing code, and 'whatis()' questions by explaining what given code does.
    You must provision your own key for the 'OpenAI' API 
    <https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference>.
